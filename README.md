# Insurance mathematics basics

My idea is to improve the understanding of non-insurance persons on how insuranc companies calculate the premiums. This file is ment not to go deeply into mathematics/ statistics, but rather show simplyfied calculations providing some excel spreadsheets examples.

I have to give credits to Povilas.Kastanauskas@gjensidige.lt for his substantial input and ideas.
